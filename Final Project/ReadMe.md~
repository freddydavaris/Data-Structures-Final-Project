# ReadMe for COMP 15 HW6
## Song Search 

Every assignment you submit you will include a ReadMe file. The name
could be ReadMe, readme, Read-me.txt, readME, ReadMe.md (the “.md”
stands for “markdown,” which allows lightweight formatting) or almost
anything you like that has the word read followed by the word me. Exact
spelling is not important, the contents are.

The purpose of the ReadMe file is the same as the little paper insert
you get in a new appliance -- to give the reader an introduction and
overview of the product.

Your ReadMe file for the assignments **must** include:

1.  The purpose of your program

This program reads in a txt file containing 170,000 songs. Each song has its lyrics undeneath. The purpose
of this program is to read in all the files hash them into hashtables and when the user typed in the word it would 
print out the top 10 songs and all of their respetive contexts in which the word is being used. 

2.  List of files with one/or two-line summary

Hashtable.cpp/h : Hashtable implementation in which the all words are stored as alpha only. It includes two structs,
		  of hasheditems and hashedinfos.
		  
WordList.cpp/h  : Wordlist is a class implementation in which we call functions like sorting the top-10 song list
		  searching for the context artist and title of a song after a song has been input, etc.
		  
Song.cpp/h 	: Song is a class implementation of a song in which we store song title ,artist and a vector
		  of all the lyircs of the song. Songs are put in a vector which holds songs. 
hashfunc.cpp    : Contains two function definitions one of which we used to convert the string into a int before
		  we hash it into a hashtable

3.  How to compile it (saying "use included Makefile" is ok)

Use included Makefile.

4.  Outline of data structure (depending on the assignment)

In this project many data structures were used in order for the final output to be generated. A song class which held
all the information about the songs was held into a vector of songs which was built as songs were read into the database.
This song class was pointed to by a pointer to the song that was held in a struct of song information. This struct held a 
pointer to the song class and the number of times every word of every song was used in the song. 


5.  Outline of algorithm (depending on the assignment)


6.  A list of people who materially helped you on the assignment. If
    you worked with a friend and you shared ideas, you need to 
    list that person, e.g., "Josh Whedon helped me on this assignment".
    You do not need to list TAs, or professors, but you may feel free
    to do so.

The ReadMe file shows the reader, in a quick glance, what the program is
about and gives a general idea of how it works. For short programs the
readme file will be short, for more complicated programs the readme file
will be longer.

Use outline form rather than long discursive paragraphs. A ReadMe file
is an overview.

There is no correct readme format; within these guidelines, devise your
own style.
