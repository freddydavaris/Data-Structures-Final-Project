HW6 Song Search Design

In this project, in order to pass in the whole list of variables 
I will be using vector to pass in the songs. In each vector, each
 word of the song will be added in a trie. Each component of the 
trie will be holding a pointer to the part of the song in which the
 word is being used and the frequency of one word in a specific song

When searching for a word, the code will be going through the song 
vector in each song individually to the desired word and checking
 indexes of frequency of word use, if the word is used in more than
 10 songs then the search will limit the output songs to the top ten 
songs that come up, and if the (i.e.) 10th and 11th song have the
 searched word the same number of times then at random one of two
 songs will be chosen to close the 10 song list.
