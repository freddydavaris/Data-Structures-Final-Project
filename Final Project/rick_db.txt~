Cry For Help 
thesdfsdz's taken my time
convinced me she's fine
but when she leaves I'm not so sure.
It's always the same: she's playing her game
and when she goes I feel to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as it seems.
Why don't I feel a cry for help?
Wh y don't I hear a cry for help?
I wandered around the streets of this town
trying to find sense in it all.
The rain on my face it covers the trace
of all the tears I've had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions
why must we never break down and cry?
All that I need is to cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All I can do is cry for help.
No need to feel ashamed
release the pain and cry for help.
Cry for help is all I need
all I need is a cry for help.
Cry for help is all I need
all I need is a cry for help.
Why must we hide emotions?
Why can we never break down and cry?
All that I need is cry for help.
I will be there when you cry for help.
Why don't I hear a cry for help?
